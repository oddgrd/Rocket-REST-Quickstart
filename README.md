# Rocket Postgres API quickstart-template (WIP)

The aim of this project is to create a quickstart-template for a Rocket REST-API with some route examples, authentication and database-setup (in this case Postgres with Diesel.rs ORM). As I am new to Rust and Rocket, this is also an educational project.

TODO: telemetry, CI.

## Testing

Run tests against a temporary Postgres docker container with `./scripts/test.sh` from the root of the source tree.  

Install Docker: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/.
